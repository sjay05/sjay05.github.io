### [Investigating the RSA Cipher & Diffe-Hellman Key Exchange](https://sjay05.github.io/MathEE.pdf)
- Covered and proved Modular Arithmetic & Number Theory Essentials (FLT, CRT) to introduce the RSA Cipher and provide a proof of correctness.
- My **Mathematics Extended Essay** that I completed for the IB Diploma

### [The relationship of Temperature (ËšT) on the spring constant of Polymer molecules](https://sjay05.github.io/SL_Physics_IA.pdf)
- Investigated an extension into Young's modulus (by comparing stress/strain under varying temperatures)
- Outlined the limitations of Hooke's law in the real-world by considering the elasticity of rubber-like materials
- My **Phyics Internal Assessment** that I completed for the IB Diploma (SL Physics)
